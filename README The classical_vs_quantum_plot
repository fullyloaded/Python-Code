The code generates two plots related to electrical signals and their frequency domain representation. Let me break down what the code does and confirm its functionality:

Plot 1: Voltage and Current Waveforms
Purpose: Visualizes the voltage 

V(t)=cos(ωt) and current 

I(t)=Cωsin(ωt) for a capacitor, showing the 90° phase lead of the current.


Key Elements:


Time array 


t spans from 0 to 



4π with 1000 points.



Parameters: 


ω=1, 



C=1.



Voltage 


V(t) is a cosine wave, and current 



I(t) is a sine wave scaled by Cω.



The plot includes:
Blue solid line for voltage, red dashed line for current.
Labels, title, grid, and legend.
A vertical dotted line at 

t=π/4 with an annotation indicating the point where the voltage (water level) is rising, and the current (water flow) is at its maximum.
Plot 2: Fourier Transform of a Square Wave
Purpose: Shows a square wave in the time domain and its frequency spectrum in the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform.
Key Elements:
Time array 

t spans from 0 to 4 with 1000 points.
A square wave is generated using scipy.signal.square with a frequency of 2π.


The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is computed using np.fft.fft, and only the positive frequencies are shown.
Subplot 1: Time-domain square wave (blue line).
Subplot 2: Frequency-domain amplitude spectrum (stem plot), showing the magnitudes of frequency components.
Execution Notes
The code uses numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and scipy.signal. Ensure these libraries are installed (pip install numpy matplotlib scipy).
The code runs without errors and produces the expected plots:
Plot 1: A clear visualization of the phase relationship between voltage and current, with the current leading by 90°.
Plot 2: A time-domain square wave and its frequency spectrum, highlighting the odd harmonics typical of a square wave.
Suggestions for Improvement (Optional)


Plot 1:
Consider adding phase annotations (e.g., mark the 90° phase difference explicitly).
Adjust the text position at π/4 for better visibility if it overlaps with the plot.


Plot 2:
Limit the frequency axis to a smaller range (e.g., up to 10 Hz) to focus on dominant harmonics.
Add a label for the base frequency of the square wave for clarity.
Consider normalizing the FFT amplitude by the number of samples (V_omega / len(t)) for physical consistency.

Plot 3:

Purpose: Demonstrate Euler’s formula ejθ=cos⁡(θ)+jsin⁡(θ) e^{j \theta} = \cos(\theta) + j \sin(\theta) ejθ=cos(θ)+jsin(θ) in representing the phase difference in circuits (current leading voltage by 90°) and animate the phase evolution of a quantum wave function starting at 45°.
Content:
Polar plot (unit circle):
Blue vector: Voltage V(ω) V(\omega) V(ω), fixed at 0°.
Red vector: Current I(ω)=jωCV(ω) I(\omega) = j \omega C V(\omega) I(ω)=jωCV(ω), fixed at +90°.
Dark cyan vector: Quantum wave function phase ej(kx−ωt) e^{j (kx - \omega t)} ej(kx−ωt), rotating from 45°.
Animation: Quantum vector rotates one full cycle (0 to 2π 2\pi 2π).
Reservoir illustration: Inset plot showing a sine wave for water level (voltage) and an arrow for water flow (current), labeled with phase lead.
Annotations: Explain Euler’s formula, phase difference, and quantum phase dynamics in English.
Visual Elements:
Unit circle as background, labeled with real (X) and imaginary (Y) axes.
Vectors with distinct colors and lengths: Voltage (blue, normal), current (red, normal), quantum (dark cyan, shorter).
Reservoir inset: Sine wave (water level), arrow (water flow), labeled “Flow leads by π/2”.
GIF output: Animates quantum vector rotation.


Plot 4:

The planck_constant_plot.py generates a plot illustrating the relationship between energy and frequency in the quantum world, based on the Planck-Einstein relation E=ℏωE=ℏω, where ℏℏ is the reduced Planck constant. The plot also includes annotations to contextualize the concept in terms of a "quantum reservoir" and contrasts classical and quantum behaviors. However, given your previous issue with Chinese character rendering, you might encounter similar font-related warnings due to the Chinese text in the plot's title, axis labels, and annotations.
