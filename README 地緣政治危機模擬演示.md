Taiwan Influence Dynamics Simulation
I'll create a Taiwan Influence Dynamics Simulation that visualizes geopolitical influence flows between the U.S., China, Taiwan, and other international actors, with crisis scenarios and video export functionality.

I've created the Taiwan Influence Dynamics Simulation with all the features you specified. Here's what the simulation includes:

## Key Features:

**🎮 Interactive Controls:**
- Start/Pause animation button
- Crisis trigger button (φ₃ Crisis mode)
- Video recording functionality (10-second export)

**🌐 Geopolitical Actors:**
- **φ₁ (美國)** - Blue node representing U.S. influence
- **φ₂ (中國)** - Orange node representing Chinese pressure
- **φ₃ (台灣)** - Green node as the focal point
- **φ₄ (日本 & 歐盟)** - Red and purple nodes for other international actors

**📊 Visual Effects:**
- **Influence flows** - Colored lines showing different relationship types (support, pressure, cooperation, competition)
- **Flowing particles** - Dynamic blue dots representing influence movement
- **Crisis mode** - Taiwan pulses and changes color, with red vacuum bubbles appearing
- **Pulsing connections** - Links intensify during crisis scenarios

**🎥 Video Export:**
- Records 10 seconds of animation
- Exports as WebM format
- Progress bar with auto-stop
- Canvas-based recording for smooth playback

**🎨 Crisis Scenarios:**
- Vacuum bubbles show areas where Taiwan's influence vanishes
- Taiwan node becomes unstable (pulsing, color changes)
- Enhanced connection flows during tensions

The simulation visualizes how Taiwan sits at the center of U.S.-China competition, with Japan and EU playing supporting roles. During crisis mode, you can see how cross-strait tensions affect the entire influence network, creating instability and power vacuums.

Try starting the animation and triggering a crisis to see the full dynamics in action!
