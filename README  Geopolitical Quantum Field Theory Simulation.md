# Geopolitical Quantum Field Theory Simulation

A sophisticated React-based interactive visualization that applies quantum field theory principles to geopolitical dynamics, demonstrating how different international actors interact under various global scenarios.

## üåü Overview

This simulation models international relations through the lens of quantum field theory, where:
- **Quantum Fields** represent geopolitical actors (US, China, Taiwan, Other International Actors)
- **Particles** represent political influence, economic ties, or information flow
- **Field Interactions** simulate cooperation, competition, and conflict dynamics
- **Vacuum Bubbles** represent instability and crisis points

## üöÄ Features

### Interactive Controls
- **Play/Pause**: Control simulation execution
- **Reset**: Return to normal state scenario
- **Scenario Selection**: Switch between different geopolitical contexts

### Simulation Scenarios
1. **Normal State**: Baseline international relations with standard cooperation/competition
2. **Trade War**: Economic tensions with increased competition factors
3. **Military Conflict**: High tension scenario with maximum field repulsion
4. **Economic Recession**: Global economic downturn affecting all actors
5. **Tech Decoupling**: Technology separation creating new interaction patterns

### Visual Elements
- **Gradient Fields**: Radial gradients representing influence zones
- **Dynamic Particles**: 100+ particles following physics-based movement
- **Vacuum Bubbles**: Red instability zones that expand and dissipate
- **Real-time Animation**: Smooth 60fps rendering with requestAnimationFrame

## üî¨ Physics Model

### Field Definitions
- **œÜ‚ÇÅ (United States)**: High stability field with cooperative tendencies toward other international actors
- **œÜ‚ÇÇ (China)**: High stability field with competitive dynamics
- **œÜ‚ÇÉ (Taiwan)**: Medium stability field, highly influenced by external pressures
- **œÜ‚ÇÑ (Other International Actors)**: Lower stability field affected by major power policies

### Force Calculations
```javascript
// Attraction force within field radius
const force = (field.stability * 0.02) / (distance + 1);

// Competition between US and China
const competitionForce = config.competitionFactor / (distance + 1);

// US-Others cooperation
const cooperationForce = config.usOtherCooperation / (distance + 1);

// Taiwan repulsion during crisis scenarios
const repulsionForce = config.twRepulsion / (distance + 1);
```

### Scenario Parameters
Each scenario modifies key parameters:
- **Field Stability**: Individual stability coefficients for each actor
- **Bubble Frequency**: Rate of instability zone creation
- **Bubble Intensity**: Size and impact of vacuum bubbles
