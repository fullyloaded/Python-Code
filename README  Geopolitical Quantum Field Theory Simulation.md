Understanding the Visualization
Field Representations

φ₁ (United States): Blue field with high stability and cooperative tendencies
φ₂ (China): Orange field with robust stability and competitive dynamics
φ₃ (Taiwan): Green field with medium stability, highly susceptible to external influences
φ₄ (International Actors): Purple field representing other nations and international organizations

Particle Dynamics

Gray particles: Standard diplomatic/economic interactions
Blue particles: High-energy policy decisions
Red particles: Crisis-level interactions
Gold particles: Special strategic moves

Visual Effects

Red bubbles: Instability zones and regional tensions
Green fields: Areas of international cooperation
Particle clustering: Represents alliance formation and policy coordination

📊 Scenarios Explained
1. Normal State

Stability: Balanced field strengths
Characteristics: Standard diplomatic interactions, moderate cooperation
Particle Count: 150 (baseline)

2. Trade War

Stability: Increased US-China competition
Characteristics: Economic decoupling, reduced Taiwan stability
Effects: Increased instability bubbles, higher particle energy

3. Military Conflict

Stability: Heightened tensions, maximum field competition
Characteristics: Severe Taiwan instability, increased international involvement
Effects: Maximum instability generation, highest particle count (200)

4. Economic Recession

Stability: Globally reduced field strength
Characteristics: Decreased competition, increased cooperation necessity
Effects: Reduced particle count (120), lower energy interactions

5. Tech Decoupling

Stability: Asymmetric US advantage, moderate China stability
Characteristics: Strategic technology competition
Effects: Selective cooperation, targeted competition zones

6. Global Pandemic

Stability: Moderately reduced across all fields
Characteristics: Increased cooperation needs, reduced competition
Effects: Enhanced cooperation fields, minimal instability

🔬 Technical Implementation
Quantum Field Theory Concepts Applied
Field Equations
The simulation uses modified quantum field equations:

Field Strength: φᵢ = stability × base_influence
Particle Interactions: F = Σ(φᵢ/distance²) × interaction_modifier
Vacuum Fluctuations: Instability bubbles represent quantum vacuum energy

Physics Engine

Particle Dynamics: Newtonian mechanics with field-based forces
Energy Conservation: Particle energy dissipation and regeneration
Boundary Conditions: Reflective boundaries with energy damping

Performance Optimizations

Efficient Rendering: D3.js data binding for smooth 60fps animation
Selective Updates: Metrics updated every 30 frames to reduce computational load
Memory Management: Particle lifecycle management to prevent memory leaks

📈 Metrics Explained
Real-time Measurements

Global Tension: Aggregate competitive force interactions (0-100%)
Cooperation Index: Positive-sum field interactions (0-100%)
Field Stability: Individual nation/actor stability coefficients
Active Particles: Current number of interaction particles

Interpretation Guidelines

High Tension + Low Cooperation: Crisis scenarios
Balanced Metrics: Stable international environment
Low Stability (Taiwan): Indicates regional vulnerability
Particle Count Variation: Reflects interaction intensity
