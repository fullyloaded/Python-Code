Quantum Circuit Visualization: Six Plots
Overview
This project provides a Python-based visualization tool to illustrate the connections between electrical circuits and quantum mechanics through six distinct plots. It demonstrates concepts such as voltage/current waveforms, Fourier decomposition, phase rotation, LC resonance, quantum-circuit analogies, and superconducting qubit energy levels. The visualizations use intuitive analogies (e.g., water level and flow) and mathematical rigor to bridge classical electrical engineering with quantum phenomena.
The script generates six output files (five static PNG images and one GIF animation) to aid in education and research on quantum circuits and their classical counterparts.
Features

Figure 1: Voltage and Current Waveforms:
Plots capacitor voltage ( V(t) = \cos(\omega t) ) and current ( I(t) = C \omega \sin(\omega t) ) in the time domain.
Includes a frequency-domain spectrum and a reservoir analogy (water level for voltage, flow for current).


Figure 2: Fourier Decomposition:
Displays a square wave in the time domain and its frequency spectrum, highlighting odd harmonics.
Links to quantum energy levels (referenced in Figure 6).


Figure 3: Euler’s Formula Animation:
Animates voltage, current, and quantum phase vectors on a unit circle, showing phase evolution via ( e^{j\theta} ).
Includes a reservoir analogy inset.


Figure 4: LC Resonance and Field Modes:
Plots LC circuit resonance current and quantum field mode energies ( E_n = \hbar \omega (n + \frac{1}{2}) ).


Figure 5: Quantum vs. Circuit Comparison:
Presents a table comparing physical quantities (e.g., voltage, current, energy) in circuit and quantum field contexts.


Figure 6: Superconducting Qubit:
Visualizes energy level structure of a superconducting qubit with discrete levels and transitions.
Includes a simplified Josephson junction circuit inset.


Multilingual Support: Uses fonts like Microsoft YaHei and Noto Sans CJK SC for Chinese and mathematical symbol compatibility.
Headless Compatibility: Uses Matplotlib’s Agg backend for non-interactive environments.

Prerequisites
To run the script, you need the following Python packages:

numpy
matplotlib
scipy
pillow (for GIF generation)

Install them using pip:
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pillow

Installation

Clone the repository (or download the script):git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-circuit-six-plots.git
cd quantum-circuit-six-plots


Ensure the required dependencies are installed (see Prerequisites).
Place the script The Six_Plots_Quantum_Circuit.py in your working directory.

Usage

Navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using Python:python The_Six_Plots_Quantum_Circuit.py


The script will generate:
Five PNG images: voltage_current.png, square_wave_fft.png, lc_resonance.png, quantum_circuit_table.png, superconducting_qubit.png.
One GIF animation: euler_animation.gif.
A console message confirming successful generation of all files.



Parameters
Key parameters in the script can be modified:

General:
time: Time array for Figures 1 and 3 (default: 0 to ( 4\pi ), 1000 points).
square_wave_time: Time array for Figure 2 (default: 0 to 4, 1000 points).
ω: Angular frequency (default: 1 rad/s).
capacitance: Capacitance (default: 1 F).
inductance: Inductance (default: 1 H).
ℏ: Reduced Planck constant (default: ( 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} ) J·s).


Figure 3 (Animation):
Frame step size (default: 0.1) and duration (default: 50 ms per frame, 20 fps).


Figure 6 (Qubit):
qubit_frequency: Qubit frequency (default: 5 GHz).



Output
The script produces:

voltage_current.png: Time and frequency domain plots of voltage and current with a reservoir analogy inset.
square_wave_fft.png: Square wave and its frequency spectrum, noting quantum energy level connections.
euler_animation.gif: Animated unit circle showing voltage, current, and quantum phase evolution.
lc_resonance.png: LC resonance current and quantum field mode energies.
quantum_circuit_table.png: Table comparing circuit and quantum field quantities.
superconducting_qubit.png: Superconducting qubit energy levels with a Josephson junction inset.
Console output: Confirms successful generation of all files.

Notes

The script uses the Agg backend (matplotlib.use('Agg')) for compatibility with headless environments (e.g., servers without GUI).
Fonts like Microsoft YaHei and Noto Sans CJK SC ensure proper rendering of Chinese and mathematical symbols. If unavailable, it falls back to DejaVu Sans with a warning.
The animation (Figure 3) generates temporary frame files in a temp_frames directory, which are deleted after creating euler_animation.gif.
Ensure sufficient disk space for temporary files during animation generation.
For interactive environments, you may comment out matplotlib.use('Agg') to display plots directly.
