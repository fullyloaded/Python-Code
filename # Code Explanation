1. Parameter Setup:
    `N = 6`: Six actors.
    `T = 200`: Simulation time steps, covering 1985-1995.
    `lambda_ = 0.5`: Non-linear parameter.
    `k = 0.2`: Fiscal bankruptcy impact coefficient.

2. Initial Conditions:
    Soviet government initial value is 1, other actors are 0.1.

3. Adjacency Matrix A:
    Using adjusted matrix, reflecting the negative impact of fiscal bankruptcy on the Soviet government.

4. Fiscal Bankruptcy F₁(t):
    Defined as a piecewise function, simulating economic pressure increasing over time:
     1985-1990: Slow increase.
     1990-1991: Rapid deterioration.
     After 1991: Stabilized at high negative value.

5. Dynamics:
    Using simplified first-order form: `dϕᵢ/dt = -λϕᵢ(ϕᵢ² - 1) + ∑ⱼ Aᵢⱼ(ϕⱼ - ϕᵢ) + Fᵢ + ηᵢ`.
    Numerically integrated using the Euler method.

6. Visualization:
   - Plots each actor's power field ϕᵢ(t) changes over time.
   - Marks key time points of 1990 and 1991 dissolution.

# Numerical Analysis

Power changes of main actors:
Soviet Government (red): Starting from a high power level, rapidly declining to near 0 during the 1991 dissolution
Russian Federation (blue): Rapidly rising after 1991 and stabilizing at a high position
USA (green): Slowly strengthening over time, especially after 1991
Eastern European Countries (purple): Slowly strengthening over time, similar trend to USA
Communist Party Conservatives (orange): Brief rise around the 1991 dissolution, then rapidly declining and maintaining a low level
Western European Allies (brown): Maintaining a medium power level with relatively small changes

Key time point data:
1990 (t=50): Although the Soviet government still dominated, its power had begun to decline, and other actors were slowly strengthening
1991 Dissolution (t=150): A clear turning point, Soviet government power rapidly collapsed, Russian Federation and USA became the dominant forces
