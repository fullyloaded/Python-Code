Field Theory Prototype in Evolutionary Economics 
evolutionary_economics_simulation
This is an evolutionary economic model that simulates the space-time dynamics of technological innovation using quantum field theory methods to simulate the evolution of the technological knowledge field (phi) and agent density field (rho). The code generates static charts (containing four subplots) through the plot_results method and creates animations through the create_animation method to visualize the simulation results.
Subplot 1: Evolution of the Technological Field (φ)
Description: The blue curve shows the spatial distribution of the technological field at each time step.
Dynamic Features:
The initial Gaussian distribution gradually diffuses or deforms over time.
If φ develops multiple peaks, this may indicate the emergence of multiple innovation centers.
Economic Interpretation:
Represents the diffusion of innovative technology from a central source, leading to the formation of regional innovation clusters or a multi-polar innovation system.
 Subplot 2: Evolution of Agent Distribution (ρ)
Description: The red curve shows how agents (e.g., firms) respond to changes in φ.
Dynamic Features:
Initially concentrated distribution gradually shifts toward regions with higher φ values.
The elasticity of this adjustment reflects firms’ technological sensitivity and relocation costs.
Economic Interpretation:
Analogous to firms clustering around innovation resources or technological hubs, reflecting spatial agglomeration effects in a knowledge-based economy.

Economic Implications
The animation dynamically illustrates the following:
φ(x, t): The diffusion and clustering phenomena of the technological knowledge field over space and time.
ρ(x, t): How agents (e.g., firms) spatially follow the movement of technological centers, demonstrating knowledge-driven spatial migration behavior.
