Optimization and Integration Plan
Modular Code Structure:
Organize the code into functions for each plot to improve readability and reusability.
Use a main function to orchestrate the generation of all plots.
Share common parameters (e.g., time arrays, frequencies) where possible to ensure consistency.
Plot 1: Voltage and Current Waveforms:
Keep the existing functionality: visualize 
V(t)=cos(ωt) and I(t)=Cωsin(ωt).
Enhance annotations for clarity, explaining the 90° phase lead in the context of a capacitor.
Add a subtle reservoir analogy (sine wave for water level, arrow for flow) as an inset to connect to Plot 3.
Plot 2: Fourier Transform of a Square Wave:
Retain the time-domain and frequency-domain plots.
Improve labeling to clarify the odd harmonics of a square wave.
Add a brief annotation linking the frequency domain to quantum mechanics (e.g., frequency components relate to energy levels in Plot 4).
Plot 3: Euler’s Formula and Quantum Phase Animation:
Create a plot with a unit circle showing 
𝑒^(𝑗𝜃) = cos(𝜃) + 𝑗·sin(𝜃).
Visualize vectors for voltage
cos(ωt)), current
sin(ωt)), and a quantum wave function starting at 45°.
Include an inset reservoir analogy (sine wave for water level, arrow for flow) to tie to Plot 1.
Animate the quantum vector’s phase evolution and save as a GIF.
Add annotations explaining Euler’s formula, phase lead, and quantum phase dynamics in simple English.
Plot 4: Planck-Einstein Relation:
Plot the linear relationship 
E=ℏω to show energy vs. frequency.
Include a "quantum reservoir" analogy: energy as water level, frequency as flow rate.
Contrast classical (continuous) vs. quantum (discrete) behaviors with annotations.
Add a secondary axis to show photon wavelengths for context.
Visual Consistency:
Use a consistent color scheme (e.g., blue for voltage/energy, red for current/flow, dark cyan for quantum).
Standardize fonts, grid styles, and figure sizes.
Ensure all plots have clear titles, labels, and legends.
Educational Annotations:
Each plot should include concise annotations in plain English to explain concepts (e.g., phase lead, Fourier transform, Euler’s formula, Planck’s constant).
Use the reservoir analogy consistently to bridge classical and quantum concepts.
Output:
Save static plots as PNG files for high quality.
Save the animation as a GIF for Plot 3.
Ensure the code is executable with minimal dependencies (numpy, matplotlib, scipy).
