Enhanced Social Quantum Field Simulation Framework
Overview
This project implements a 1D quantum field simulation framework to model social dynamics inspired by quantum field theory. The simulation captures field evolution, vacuum expectation values, energy density, spatial correlations, phase space dynamics, and an entanglement approximation. It uses a scalar field with a time-dependent nonlinear coupling to mimic synaptic plasticity and includes external driving forces. The results are visualized through six animated subplots and a separate phase space plot.
Features

Field Evolution: Simulates a scalar field φ(x,t) with a Gaussian initial perturbation.
Dynamic Coupling: Models synaptic plasticity via a time-dependent nonlinear coupling λ(t).
Comprehensive Visualizations:
Animated field evolution and energy density plots.
Time series of vacuum expectation value, spatial correlations, and entanglement approximation.
Phase space trajectory at the center point.


Numerical Stability: Verifies Laplacian calculations for accuracy.
Entanglement Approximation: Computes mutual correlations between spatial windows as a proxy for entanglement.

Prerequisites
To run the simulation, you need the following Python packages:

numpy
matplotlib

You can install them using pip:
pip install numpy matplotlib

Installation

Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/enhanced-social-quantum-field-simulation.git
cd enhanced-social-quantum-field-simulation


Ensure the required dependencies are installed (see Prerequisites).
Download the main script Enhanced Social Quantum Field Simulation Framework.py.

Usage

Place the script in your working directory.
Run the script using Python:python Enhanced\ Social\ Quantum\ Field\ Simulation\ Framework.py


The simulation will:
Perform a 300-step simulation of the quantum field.
Display a figure with six subplots showing field evolution, vacuum expectation value, energy density, spatial correlations, phase space, and entanglement approximation.
Show a separate phase space plot.
Print a message verifying the Laplacian calculation.



Parameters
Key simulation parameters can be modified in the script:

N: Number of spatial grid points (default: 100).
L: Spatial domain length (default: 100).
dt: Time step (default: 0.05).
T: Total time steps (default: 300).
lam_base: Baseline nonlinear coupling (default: 0.1).
epsilon: External driving amplitude (default: 0.05).
omega: External driving frequency (default: 0.1).

Output
The script generates:

A multi-panel figure with animated subplots for field evolution and energy density.
Static plots for vacuum expectation value, spatial correlations, phase space, and entanglement approximation.
A separate phase space plot for the center point trajectory.
Console output indicating whether the Laplacian calculation is verified.

Notes

The simulation assumes a 1D spatial grid with periodic boundary conditions implicitly handled by the gradient calculations.
The entanglement approximation uses mutual correlations between spatial windows, which is a simplified proxy.
Ensure your system supports Matplotlib's animation functionality for smooth visualization.
