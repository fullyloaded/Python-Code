Python Simulation Example Combining "Synaptic Pruning and Formation" with "Quantum Gate Reconfiguration"
This example uses a simplified neural network and quantum logic gate network to simulate how synaptic structures adjust during learning, analogous to the dynamic reconfiguration of quantum logic structures.



Simulation Function Description
Each time step simulates an update from learning or experience.

In the neural network, synapses may:

Be removed (simulating synaptic pruning)

Be added (simulating synaptic growth during learning)

In the quantum logic network:

Some gates may be removed due to efficiency or environmental decoherence

New gates may be added, simulating the activation of new logical functions

Full Python Module Simulation Combining “Neural Synaptic Plasticity” and “Quantum Logic Reconfiguration”
This simulation demonstrates the co-evolution of two parallel subsystems:

SynapticNetwork (Synaptic Network)

Simulates neural plasticity: Synapses are pruned or regenerated probabilistically.

Models connection changes in the brain caused by experience, stimuli, and learning.

QuantumLogicNetwork (Quantum Logic Network)

Simulates quantum cognitive structures: Quantum logic gates are randomly added or removed.

Represents reconfigurable and interference-based reasoning structures corresponding to neural logic patterns.

Summary of Simulation Results:
Over 5 time steps, the simulation proceeds as follows:

In each round, the synaptic network graph shows changes in connectivity and synaptic weights.

The quantum logic network dynamically adjusts the arrangement and positions of quantum gates, representing changes in cognitive function or consciousness structure.
